# Time's Up!! 2600
Simple reaction game of finite length. 
* An arrow appears on screen and time starts counting down
* Press the joystick in the direction indicated by the arrow
* Correct reaction scores a point and stops the clock
* Incorrect reaction leaves the clock running (TODO)
* After a short random delay this all happens again
* When time reaches 0 the game is over

## TODO
* Make time keep counting for incorrect answers
* Make the icons larger
* Make the icons appear in random places
