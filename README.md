# Time's Up!! 2600
Simple reaction game of finite length. 
* To start the game, press the up arrow
* After a delay, another arrow appears on screen and time starts counting down
* Press the joystick in the direction indicated by the arrow
* Correct reaction scores a point and stops the clock until the next arrow
* Incorrect reaction leaves the clock running until the next arrow
* After a short random delay a new arrow appears
* When time reaches 0 the game is over
* After roughly half the time has elapsed, the arrow positions become random
